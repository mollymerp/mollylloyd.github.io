### Hi there, I'm Molly. 
Nice to see you. I am a recent transplant to San Francisco by way of DC and Madison, WI. 

I enjoy building cool stuff with code, cooking and baking, playing with cameras, and hiking around when I can escape from the city.  

I'll be using this site to keep track of personal notes, code-related challenges I think may be helpful to others, and whatever else in my brain I feel has a place on the internet. 

This site is built with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
